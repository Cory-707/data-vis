# Data visualization

This repo contains materials for the 'Data Visualization - Introduction to `ggplot2`' [Eco-Data-Science](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) workshop on January 17, 2018 at UCSB. The objective is to introduce basics of creating and customizing graph using `ggplot`, including:

- The grammar of graphics
- General structure of `ggplot()` code
- Customizing axes labels and titles
- Customizing graph aesthetics (by variable)
- Faceting (`facet_wrap`)
- Types of graphs (geoms)
- Bar graphs (stacked counts, proportions, and clustered)
- Exporting graphs (`ggsave`)

## Before the workshop, you should:

- Install the `tidyverse` package if you don't have it already (`ggplot2` package is part of the `tidyverse`)
- Load the dataset `np_visit.csv` (a file containing visitor counts at National Parks in the United States)
